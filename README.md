<h1>Electric vehicle history</h1>
   

<p>
   The first electric cars debuted in the middle of the nineteenth century.
   Up until around 1900, the fastest land vehicle was an electric car. 
   Battery electric vehicle use as personal transportation decreased globally due to their high cost, 
   low top speed, and short range compared to internal combustion engine vehicles from the 20th century; 
   however, people continued to use electric vehicles as loading and charging equipment and as public transportation, 
   particularly rail vehicles.
</p>

<p>
   With the dawn of the twenty-first century, interest in electric cars and other 
   alternative fuel vehicles has grown in the private transportation vehicle sector 
   as a result of growing worries about the issues related to vehicles running on 
   hydrocarbon fuels, including the sustainability of the current hydrocarbon-based 
   transportation infrastructure as well as The advancement of electric vehicle technology.

<p>
At the end of 2019, there were 4.8 million electric vehicles in use,
 and cumulative sales of light grid electric vehicles achieved 
 the 10 threshold million unit mark by the end of 2020. Since 2010,
 global sales of all electric automobiles and electric utility vehicles
 have surpassed 1 million units. Battery electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid
 vehicle yearly sales ratios have shifted from 44:56 in 2012 to 26:74
 in 2019 to 31:69 in 2020. With sales of about 645,000 units as of August 2020, 
 the all-electric Tesla Model 3 is the best-selling plug-in passenger vehicle ever.

<h4>electric vehicle designs</h4>

<p>

There are various people who are credited with developing the first electric vehicle model.
 Annius Jedlick, a physicist and priest from Hungary, developed the first basic electric motor in 1828 
 and used it to power a miniature model automobile. Robert Anderson, a Scottish inventor, also created 
 the all-electric trolley between 1832 and 1839. A miniature electric car powered by non-rechargeable 
 primary cells was created in 1835 by Professor Sibrandus Strating of Groningen, the Netherlands, 
 and his colleague Christopher Becker, who was also from Germany.

<h4>electric-powered vehicles</h4>

Thomas Davenport, a blacksmith from Vermont, created a similar device in 1834 that ran on a brief,
 circular track powered by electricity. The Aberdeen-based chemist Robert Davidson constructed
 the first electric locomotive in Scotland in 1837. Galvanic cells, or batteries, powered it.
 Later, Davidson constructed the Galvani, a larger locomotive that was displayed at the Royal
 Scottish Society of Art exhibition in 1841.
 The vehicle weighed 7,100 kilograms (8 British tonnes), with two reluctance motors 
 that were directly coupled to the wheels, mounted electromagnets acting on iron rods 
 attached to wooden cylinders on each axle, and basic electrical exchanges. 
 It could pull a load weighing 6,100 kilograms (6 British tonnes) 
 across a distance of 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) at a speed of 6.4 kilometers per hour (4 mph). 
 In September of the following year, it was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.
 however their widespread application was impeded by the batteries' low capacity.
 The railway workers demolished it because they believed it threatened the stability of their employment.

 In England, a patent for the use of railroads as electric current conductors was awarded in 1840,
 while Lilly and Colton in the USA received similar patents in 1847.
 The KBS used the first battery-powered railroad car in 1887.
